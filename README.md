# HTML & CSS Assignment

Nothing much about this project, we(me and my groupmates) spent a week and two ,working on this.<br>

## Part Done By Me:
-The designing part (the parallax scrolling background, I got this idea from one of the CSS tutorial, props to it, I couldn't really remember where I got it from XD, Flex-boxing / grid boxing ,Most of the design part,media queries, Dropdown menu) are mostly done by me, and my teammate helped to fill out some of the informaiton we need!

## Side notes
Althought it is not a decent project! But we're pretty proud of ourself, we learned a lot through out the process, I did not think that I could ever be developing a website , working with CSS and all, but this really gave me a chance to learn and experience them. Appreciate it, might building some great website later, have some great ideas on my mind right now B)
